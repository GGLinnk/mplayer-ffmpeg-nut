DO NOT USE NUTMERGE FOR _ANYTHING_ EXCEPT TESTING!!
IT CREATES COMPLETELY INVALID BROKEN FILES, WHICH JUST "HAPPEN" TO WORK!


for MPlayer, directory structure necessary: (only CVS works)
somedir/main
somedir/nut/libnut

move demux_nut.c to libmpdemux and apply mplayer.diff


to use:
./nutmerge bla.avi bla.nut


to debug:
./riffreader bla.avi


to play:
mplayer -demuxer nut bla.nut


If you have weird endianess, test the MPlayer demuxer, because it
shouldn't work! send me some debugging stuff... Everything else
SHOULD work though! You'll need to compile with '-DWORDS_BIGENDIAN',
just uncomment the apporpiate file in the main Makefile.
