DO NOT USE NUTMERGE FOR _ANYTHING_ EXCEPT TESTING!!
IT CREATES COMPLETELY INVALID BROKEN FILES, WHICH JUST "HAPPEN" TO WORK!


instructions:
tar jfx nut.tar.bz2
cvs -z9 -d:pserver:anonymous@mplayerhq.hu:/cvsroot/mplayer co main
make -C nut
cd main
ln -s ../../nut/demux_nut.c libmpdemux/
patch -p0 --no-backup-if-mismatch < ../nut/mplayer.diff
make mplayer

In words:
have your main nut/ directory in the same level as your CVS mplayer main/ 
directory, copy demux_nut.c to libmpdemux/, apply the mplayer.diff, and 
first run make in nut directory, and then make in mplayer directory.


to use:
./nutmerge bla.avi bla.nut  # only mpeg-4 !
./nutmerge bla.ogg bla.nut  # only vorbis, not theora


to debug:
Always look at $?  !
./avireader bla.avi
./oggreader bla.ogg


to play:
mplayer bla.nut

auto detction should work fine.


to copy index to begginning of file:
./nutindex old.nut new.nut


If you have weird endianess, You'll need to compile with 
'-DWORDS_BIGENDIAN', just uncomment the appropriate file in config.mak .
