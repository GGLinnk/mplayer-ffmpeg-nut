Issue broadcast-clock-sync
--------------------------
Problem: Clock synchronization leading to buffer overflow and underflow
in the decoder.


Issue broadcast-preload-len
---------------------------
Problem: How long should the receiver preload the NUT file before starting
playback and after seeking, so no buffer over/underflow happens.

Solutions to the above 2 issues are for example storing one of the following
A. preload time
B. preload bytes
C. buffer fullness in seconds
D. buffer fullness in bytes
E. transmit time stamps

Values in bytes scale nicer with increased bandwidth, that is, doubling the
bandwidth from the one assumed by the muxer halves the needed preload. Time
based sync values do not naturally change the needed preload with increased
bandwidth but instead increase the needed buffer size.

These can be stored in one of the following
a. sync points
b. info packets
c. a new stream type

Info packets are currently not allowed to change thus they are not suitable
without that being changed.


Issue chapter-overlap/gap
-------------------------
If one changes the timebase between chapters then overlaps (forbidden by the
spec) or gaps (problematic with split & merge) can happen.

Solutions:
A. Do not change the timebase.
B. Store start and end in separate timebases (breaks compatibility).
C. Add a field into the info packet overriding the chapter_end with a
   more accurate value.
D. Use the chapter start of the next chapter (breaks compatibility and
   error robustness).

It seems the consensus is A.


Issue stream-chapter-overlap
----------------------------
It is possible especially in the light of the precision of the previous
issue, that chapters might not end exactly at the same points in time in
all streams. There could be a few samples difference.
Do we care about this?


Issue info-stream-subsets
-------------------------
Currently if info applies to more than 1 stream but not all, it has to be
duplicated for each stream it applies to.


Issue multiple-programs
-----------------------
Multiple programs (that is several audio-video stream pairs for example) can
not be stored cleanly in NUT.

Solutions:
A. one backptr per program + any solution for issue info-stream-subsets
B. Design a separate layer for it.
C. Do not support this.


Issue info-overhead
-------------------
Info can be stored much more compactly by replacing common strings by
shorter representations.

Solutions:
A. Change syntax so a v value which indexes into a fixed table can select
   info names. (breaks compatibility completely)
B. Use/allow 1 char abbreviations (new demuxers could read old files, old
   ones could read everything except the abbreviated fields).
C. Leave info as it is.


Issue edit-lists
----------------
For editing it is very useful to not rewrite the whole file after every step.

Solutions:
A. Store such edits in info packets.
B. Store such edits in info packets but allow them only in "private" NUT
   files. That is files distributed must be remuxed. Players must reject
   files with edit lists.
C. Do not support this (this would mean no interoperability between video
   editing programs using NUT as they would use their own formats to store
   edit lists).


Issue alternatives
------------------
Alternatives like a variant without some scenes or with a happy ending
instead of a tragic one cannot be stored in NUT currently.

Solutions:
A. Store such alternative playlists of scenes in info packets somehow.
B. Design a separate layer for it.
C. Do not support this.
