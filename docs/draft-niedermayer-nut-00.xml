providing citations here. -->

      <t>NUT is a multimedia container format for storage of audio, video,
      subtitles and related user defined streams, it provides exact timestamps
      for synchronization and seeking, is simple, has low overhead and can
      recover in case of errors in the stream.</t>
      <t>This document defines:
      <list style="hanging">
        <t> The file format layout
        </t>
        <t> The common stream interleaving rules
        </t>
<!--        <t> A simple provision how to map nut streams to rtp.

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>
        <t> This document refers to the following definitions
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="pts"> Presentation time of the first frame/sample that
            is completed by decoding the coded frame.
            </t>
            <t hangText="dts"> The time when a frame is input into a
            synchronous 1-in-1-out decoder.
            </t>
            <t hangText="frame"> Minimal unit of information that can be
            decoded, it is usually holds a part of video frame, a group of
            audio samples or a subtitle line.
            </t>
            <t hangText="Keyframe"> A keyframe is a frame from which you can
            start decoding.
            The nth frame is a keyframe if and only if frames n, n+1, ... in
            presentation order (that are all frames with a pts >= frame[n].pts)
            can be decoded successfully without reference to frames prior n in
            storage order (that are all frames with a dts &lt; frame[n].dts).
            If no such frames exist (for example due to using overlapped
            transforms like the MDCT in an audio codec), then the definition
            shall be extended by dropping n out of the set of frames which
            must be decodable, if this is still insufficient then n+1 shall
            be dropped, and so on until there is a keyframe.
            Every frame which is marked as a keyframe MUST be a keyframe
            according to the definition above, a muxer MUST mark every frame
            it knows is a keyframe as such, a muxer SHOULD NOT analyze future
            frames to determine the keyframe status of the current frame but
            instead just set the frame as non-keyframe.

      <section title="Syntax Convetions">
        <t> Since NUT heavily uses variable length fields, the simplest way to
        describe it is using a pseudocode approach instead of graphical
        bitfield descriptions.
        </t>
        <t> The syntax uses datatypes, tagnames and C-like constructs. </t>

           Values can be encoded using the following logic: the data is in
           network order, every byte has the most significant bit used as
           flag and the following 7 used to store the value.
           The first N bit are to be taken, where N is number of bits
           representing the value modulo 7, and stored in the first byte.
           If there are more bits, the flag bit is set to 1 and the subsequent
           7bit are stored in the following byte, if there are remaining bits
           set the flag to 1 and the same procedure is repeated. <br />
           The ending byte has the flag bit set to 0.
           In order to decode it is enough to iterate over the bytes until the
           flag bit set to 0, for every byte the data is added to the
           accumulated value multiplied by 128.

            The signed values are encoded as the absolute value multiplied by
            2, positive numbers have 1 subtracted to the value. [FIXME: why not

            Strings and binary data can be encoded basically writing the byte
